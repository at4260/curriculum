### Mini Lesson

Introduction to Refactoring (15 mins)
- Purpose
- Impact in a corporate code base (importance of managing "technical debt", working in "legacy code")
- Funky code to look for (ex: magic numbers, unhelpful variable names, etc.)
- Leveraging functions
- Using libraries
- Keeping code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Test your code to make sure you didn't break any functionality
Refactoring Guided Practice (30 mins)


### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
This is something that students might not realize or might assume at first.
- Importance of testing to ensure that refactoring doesn't break anything
- Knowing when refactoring is worth the investment (sometimes it may not be)

### Guided Practice
Work through some small practice examples.

### Independent Practice
Code to refactor.
Articles to read about technical debt.

### Challenge
Additional code to refactor.
